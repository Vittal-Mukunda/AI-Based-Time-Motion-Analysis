# AI-Based-Time-Motion-Analysis
An intelligent time and motion study framework that integrates YOLO-based hand/object detection with MediaPipe landmark tracking to quantify manual work. The system extracts motion metrics and maps them to Therbligs, enabling data-driven productivity, cycle-time, and work measurement analysis.
